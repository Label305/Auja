Great frameworks are not built by a single person, they are built together! To get up and running with developing for Auja you'll need to understand
how things are laced together.
</p>

First thing: React! Auja uses the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) framework to render while implementing the [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) architecture to manage dataflow and dispatching within the application. To ease implementation of this architecture we use [Fluxxor](http://fluxxor.com/).
