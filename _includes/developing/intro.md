Great frameworks are not built by a single person, they are built together! To get up and running with developing for Auja you'll need to understand
how thing are laced together. In this section we'll describe the inner workings and design choices so contributing will be a breeze.
</p>

First thing: React! Auja uses the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) framework to render while implementing the [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) architecture to manage dataflow and dispatching within the application. To ease implementation of this architecture we use [Fluxxor](http://fluxxor.com/).
