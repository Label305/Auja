<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
<p class="leading">
Within the <a href="https://github.com/Label305/Auja">Auja repository</a>, you will find the JavaScript source meant to be used together with a back-end implementation for your preferred framework.
</p>
To use Auja, a complete package is needed. For example, if you want to use Auja for a Laravel implementation, you will need something like this:

`Auja - Auja-Laravel - Laravel application`

So, Auja can be used with different back-end implementations as long as the implementation between Auja and the preferred framework exists.
At this moment, there is an implementation for [Laravel PHP](https://github.com/Label305/Auja-Laravel) in progress, but you can contribute and build your own implementation.

To ease up implementation of the communication protocol we provide a [toolkit](https://github.com/Label305/Auja-PHP) for PHP providing interfaces and
scaffolding.
