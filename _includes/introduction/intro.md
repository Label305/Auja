<p class="leading">
Auja is a back-end interface designed designed to be friendly on both sides, for the end-user as well as the developer.
In this repo you'll find the JavaScript source meant to be used together with a back-end implementation for your 
   preferred framework, whatever server side language you use.
</p>

Current back-end implementations:
   
   - [Laravel](https://github.com/Label305/Auja-Laravel) ... coming soon
   - Your implementation here..!?
   
To ease up implementation of the communication protocol we provide a [toolkit](https://github.com/Label305/Auja-PHP) for PHP providing interfaces and
scaffolding.
